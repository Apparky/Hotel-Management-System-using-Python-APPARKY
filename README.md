You can also convert this program in to exe file. You just neet to install [`Babel`](https://babel.pocoo.org/en/latest/) for that

```commandline
pip install Babel
```

And also follow the given code to all your project files like this
```commandline
from babel.numbers import *
from babel.dates import *
```
`Babel` is used to fix images in `exe` version of your code.

You also need [`Pyinstaller`](https://pyinstaller.org/en/stable/). This library converts the `.py` scripts to `exe`.

To install `Pyinstaller` follow the given command billow.

```

We have added a `requirement.txt` file with this repo. You can also install all requirements from this file. 
You just need to open you native terminal or any terminal and type in the following commands
```commandline
pip install -r requirement.txt
```

You are all set to go. Open your native terminal and run the following command to convert your `.py` script into `exe` file.

# in this project the filename.py is hotel.py
```
